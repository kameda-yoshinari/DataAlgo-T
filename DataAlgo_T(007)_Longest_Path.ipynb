        "\n",
        "A weight of an edge between vertex A and vertex B is denoted edge(A,B).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose we think of a vertex K in a given graph.  \n",
        "Let's say that the maximum length of the paths that ends at K is denoted by W(K).\n",
        "Then, the definition of the problem is to find the vertex K_max and its W(K_max) where W(K_max) is the longest for all the vertices in the graph\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we assume that we are processing the vertex T.\n",
        "We also assume all the W(S) have been obtained for all the vertices S that are located at source (upper) side of Vertex T.  \n",
        "The source side can be determined by executing the topological sorting in advance.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Then, W(D) should be calculated by:\n",
        "> W(D) = max ( W(S) + edge(S,D) )   \n",
        "> for any S in the source side of D  \n",
        "\n",
        "After we obtain all the W(D) for any vertice D in the graph, finally we find the largerst W(K_max) by just scanning all the W(D).\n",
