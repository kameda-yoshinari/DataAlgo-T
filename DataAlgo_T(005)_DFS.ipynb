        "Write DFS program by using recursive function calls that are C language nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Stack should be organized by the smart use of recursive function calls of C language.\n",
        "On calling a function in C language, its arguments and local variables are stored in stack area.\n",
        "When we call the same function for the several times, they are stacked (pushed) every time when the function is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "This indicates the program shall be compact as we do not need to prepare stack operations by ourselves anymore.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Program**\n",
        "\n",
        "The use of listed[] and visited[] are same as before, but they are prepared as global variables because they are accessed at any function calls.\n",
        "Initialization of the global variables are done at main function.\n",
        "Result is also shown at the main function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the alogirhm is slightly different from the previous one because this program visits the new vertex while it is checking the adjacency of all the vertices in the graph (in other words, before checking ALL the adjacent vertices).\n",
        "\n",
        "The stack diagram below is showing the relationship between the procedure and the stack area. Multiple \"RoomToCheck and CurrentRoom\" variable sets are stored (at most 4-layered; this means reccursive calls are 4 times nested). The arrow at RoomToCheck (X to Y) local variable indicates the loop (line 31-41) is going down from initial value X to value Y. If the Y comes to N (N=8 here), it means the recursive function call of that time ends.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Remarks**\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the stack is changed in the different fashion as the previous program. Yet the result is the same."
