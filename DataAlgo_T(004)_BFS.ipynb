At this time, the unenumerated vertices adjacent to the vertex is put on the tail of the waiting line (connect them to the queue). When the investigation of a particular vertex is completed, the next vertex to investigate is the oldest one in the queue (First-In-First-Out). The reason for this is that it becomes the vertex farther from the starting vertex as the one connected later. \n",
